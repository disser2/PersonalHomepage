  abstract = { Use of techniques derived from generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), offer a transformative potential on the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent LLMs have exhibited remarkable skills in producing and understanding human-like texts. The integration of AI in imaging applications and the deployment of foundation models for the classification and prognosis of disease course, including disability progression and even therapy response, have received considerable attention. However, the use of LLMs within the context of MS remains relatively underexplored. LLMs have the potential to support several activities related to MS management. Clinical decision support systems could help selecting proper disease-modifying therapies; AI-based tools could leverage unstructured real-world data for research or virtual tutors may provide adaptive education materials for neurologists and people with MS in the foreseeable future. In this focused review, we explore practical applications of LLMs across the continuum of MS management as an initial scope for future analyses, reflecting on regulatory hurdles and the indispensable role of human supervision. }

	abstract = {Nonwoven materials consist of random fiber structures. They are essential to diverse application areas such as clothing, insulation and filtering. A long term goal in industry is the simulation-based optimization of material properties in dependence of the manufacturing parameters. Recent works developed a framework to predict tensile strength properties representing the fiber structure as a stochastic graph. In this paper we present an efficient machine learning approach using a regression model trained on features extracted from the graph, for which we develop a novel graph stretching algorithm. We demonstrate that applying our method to a practically relevant dataset yields similar prediction results as the original ODE approach (R2=0.98), while achieving a significant speedup by up to three orders of magnitude. This opens the field to optimization, as Monte Carlo simulations accounting for the stochastic nature of nonwovens become easily accessible. Our model generalizes well to unseen parameter combinations. Additionally, our approach produces interpretable results by using a simple linear model for the regression task.}
